cost-effective-remote-compute
===

Software diagrams to try to perform "training" and "inference,
with an as low initial spend as possible.

Goals:
- Leverage remote compute, so no local hardware requires
- Extensible, so new frameworks/tools/libraries/languages can be introduced easily
- Cost-effective, so when it's not being used, the cost is as close to 0 as possible
